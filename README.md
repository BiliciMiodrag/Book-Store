I developed an online book store where users can:

register/login;
reset password;
can buy books with price and quantity;
manage their profile;
And an administrator can:

register another user and select type of user;
CRUD operations with books and publishers;
manage their profile;
viewing statistics etc;
For developing I used PHP for backend, and HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and Ajax for the rest of the application.
